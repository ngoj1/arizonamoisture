Dataset Abstract

	Daily average of 30-minute Volumetric Water Content at NPP C-CALI met station. Collection of soil volumetric water content data at Jornada LTER NPP sites, New Mexico, supports the environmental monitoring objectives of the Jornada LTER monitoring program that look at plant-soil water dynamics. Volumetric water content, bulk electrical conductivity, soil temperature, and bulk dielectric permittivity are measured and calculated at an automated meteorological station installed at Jornada LTER NPP C-CALI site. The daily average at 3 soil depths is calculated from measurements made every 30 minutes at 10 cm, 20 cm, and 30 cm.     This is an ONGOING dataset.
