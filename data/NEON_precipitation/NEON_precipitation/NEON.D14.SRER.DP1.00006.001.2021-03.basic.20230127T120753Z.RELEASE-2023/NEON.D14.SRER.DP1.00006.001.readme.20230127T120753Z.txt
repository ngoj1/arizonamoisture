DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION

------------------------



ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.00006.001



Name: Precipitation



Description: Bulk precipitation collected using up to three methods - primary, secondary, and throughfall. Bulk precipitation is determined at five- and thirty-minute intervals for primary precipitation and at one- and thirty-minute intervals for secondary and throughfall precipitation.



NEON Science Team Supplier: Terrestrial Instrument System



Abstract: Up to three methods are used to determine bulk precipitation at each site. Primary - weighing gauge housed within a small double fence intercomparison reference (DFIR). Secondary - tipping bucket located on the top of the tower at terrestrial sites or at approx. 1.5 m above the ground at aquatic sites. Throughfall - tipping buckets below the canopy and equipped with troughs extending outward from the tipping bucket.  

Latency:
Data collected in any given month are published during the second full week of the following month.



Brief Design Description: Precipitation records are fundamental to understanding water availability in an ecosystem. In turn, evapotranspiration and latent heat fluxes can be better understood and climate conditions can be better modeled. Bulk precipitation measured using a DFIR and a weighing gauge is known to provide improved results over tipping bucket measurements. Thus, the weighing gauge surrounded by the DFIR is considered the “primary” method, while the tipping bucket is referred to as the “secondary” method. Throughfall precipitation informs interception of precipitation by the canopy and pass-through to the soil surface.



Brief Study Area Description: Primary precipitation gauges are located at all core terrestrial sites, generally located within 0.5 km of the tower infrastructure, and at some core aquatic sites. Secondary precipitation is measured at the tower top at all gradient terrestrial sites, a select few core tower sites, and aquatic sites that are more than 10 km from a terrestrial site or in a different watershed; this includes core aquatic sites that do not support the installation of a primary precipitation gauge. 
Throughfall collectors are located within the soil plots at all terrestrial sites where the canopy is seasonally taller than the height of the throughfall collector inlet. [This spreadsheet](https://www.neonscience.org/sites/default/files/PrecipSensorsBySite.xlsx) provides the quantity and type of precipitation collector(s) located at each NEON site, along with the nearby terrestrial site from which to download precipitation data for aquatic sites without precipitation collectors.



Sensor(s): Belfort AEPG II 600M weighing gauge (primary precipitation), Met One 372 tipping bucket (non-heated; secondary precipitation and throughfall) and 379 tipping bucket (heated; secondary precipitation)

Issue Date: 2020-06-11
Issue: Spurious trace precipitation is recorded frequently for all primary precipitation sensors (weighing gauges). While actual precipitation events are typically distinguishable from spurious events in the time series, the spurious events can add significantly to precipitation totals when aggregated over long intervals.  Sums of spurious precipitation range from < 0.05 mm/day to > 0.5mm/day, with higher sums generally corresponding to sites and time periods of greater evaporative demand.  
       Date Range: 2013-01-01 to 2020-06-11
       Location(s) Affected: All primary precipitation locations.
Resolution Date: 
Resolution: Issue ongoing. We are working on additional quality control algorithms in order to detect and remove spurious trace events in the primary precipitation data product. An updated algorithm is expected sometime in 2022.

Issue Date: 2022-09-12
Issue: Severe flooding destroyed several roads into Yellowstone National Park in June 2022, making the YELL and BLDE sites inaccessible to NEON staff. Preventive and corrective maintenance are not being performed, nor is the annual exchange of sensors for calibration and validation. While automated quality control routines are likely to detect and flag most issues, users are advised to review data carefully.
       Date Range: 2022-06-12 to 2022-12-31
       Location(s) Affected: YELL
Resolution Date: 
Resolution: 

Issue Date: 2022-11-10
Issue: Tree growth began causing interference between the throughfall assembly and the tree starting around 2022-05-18.
       Date Range: 2022-05-18 to 2022-11-08
       Location(s) Affected: DELA soil plot 1 (HOR: 001)
Resolution Date: 2022-11-10
Resolution: Throughfall troughs were rotated approximately 20 degrees (clockwise viewed from above) on 2022-11-08 to avoid interference. Impacts on the time series are expected to be undetectable to small due to the inherently noisy nature of throughfall data, but it is possible that a step change in the time series may occur.

Resolution Date: 2022-01-01
Resolution: Reprocessed provisional data are available now. Reprocessed data previously included in RELEASE-2021 will become available when RELEASE-2022 is issued.

Issue Date: 2021-01-11
Issue: Safety measures to protect personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduced or canceled maintenance activities for extended periods at NEON sites. Data availability and/or quality may be negatively impacted during this time.

In addition, the annual refresh of sensors and data acquisition systems (DAS) did not occur according to the typical 1-year schedule for many sites. The annual refresh is where freshly calibrated and verified sensors and DAS replace the units in the field.
       Date Range: 2020-03-23 to 2021-12-31
       Location(s) Affected: ALL
Resolution Date: 2021-12-31
Resolution: NEON reviewed data from all sites and time periods potentially impacted by COVID-19 safety precautions to identify and manually flag suspect data that escaped automated quality tests. Suspect data are indicated by the final quality flag in the data files, which should be used to inform data filtering prior to use. 

Currently, there are no quality flags indicating lack of conformance to an annual sensor refresh interval, but these are in development. Data during this time period should be treated as valid unless marked suspect by other quality flags.

Issue Date: 2018-04-03
Issue: Throughfall data and associated quality flags should be considered unreliable and of limited use. The sensor frequently becomes blocked with debris and the tipping mechanism frequently falls off its rocker, causing precipitation events to go unrecorded.

Resolution Date: 2021-05-31
Resolution: Additional screens were added to the collection troughs to minimize the amount of debris entering the sensor in fall 2017. A more robust design of the tipping mechanism was produced and all sensors were retrofitted between 2018-06 to 2021-05. All potentially impacted throughfall data were manually flagged as suspect prior to the retrofit at each site.

Issue Date: 2020-03-26
Issue: The alpha and beta quality metric multipliers used for computing the final quality flag were swapped in processing. The final quality flag is raised when alphaQM*m + betaQM*n >= 20%. The multiplier m should be set to 2 and n should be set to 1, but these values were swapped, making it slightly harder to raise the final quality flag. These multipliers were corrected in data produced after the resolution date. Data prior to the resolution date will be reprocessed prior to the first NEON data release. An additional changelog comment will be entered at that time.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

----------------------




KNOWN ISSUE 2020-06-10: A review of the precipitation data product (part of DP1.00006.001) identified that spurious trace precipitation is recorded frequently for all primary precipitation sensors (secondary and throughfall precipitation buckets are unaffected). While actual precipitation events are typically distinguishable from spurious events in the time series, the presence of spurious trace precipitation can add significantly to precipitation totals when aggregated over long intervals.  Sums of spurious precipitation range from < 0.05 mm/day to > 0.5mm/day, with higher sums generally corresponding to sites and time periods of greater evaporative demand.  We are working on additional quality control algorithms in order to detect and remove spurious trace events in the primary precipitation data product. An updated algorithm is expected sometime in 2022.
